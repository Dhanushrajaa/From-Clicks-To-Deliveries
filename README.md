# From-Clicks-To-Deliveries

Introduction

In the world of e-commerce, seamless integration between online platforms and logistics is crucial for both customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. This project leverages real-time data streams to optimize user experience and logistics management through the power of AWS services, Python, and Snowflake.

Project Overview

This project focuses on two core areas:
Online Platform Optimization: Collecting and analyzing clickstream data to enhance user experiences and optimize marketing strategies.
Fleet Management and Logistics Optimization: Utilizing IoT sensors to gather real-time telemetry data from delivery trucks to optimize routes, reduce fuel consumption, and ensure fleet reliability.

Data Collection

Clickstream Data: For three items (mobile phones, laptops, and cameras), we collect data including Item ID, Item Name, and Click Count in real-time.
Fleet Data: For three trucks, telemetry data is gathered every minute, including:
GPS Location (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Speed)
Vehicle Speed
Engine Diagnostics (Engine RPM, Fuel Level, Temperature, Oil Pressure, Battery Voltage)
Odometer Reading
Fuel Consumption
Vehicle Health and Maintenance (Brake Status, Tire Pressure, Transmission Status)
Environmental Conditions (Temperature, Humidity, Atmospheric Pressure)

Technologies Used

AWS Lambda: For processing and analyzing real-time data streams.
AWS Kinesis: Real-time data streaming for both clickstream and IoT sensor data.
DynamoDB/Snowflake: Data storage for processed clickstream and fleet telemetry data, maintaining a historical record using Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD) Type 2 schema.
Python: For generating synthetic data and processing APIs.
API Gateway: To expose data for downstream lambda functions.

Usage

1.Setup AWS Services:
Deploy Lambda functions for processing clickstream and fleet telemetry data.
Configure AWS Kinesis streams to collect real-time data.
Set up DynamoDB or Snowflake for historical data storage.
2.Data Simulation:
Run Python scripts to simulate clickstream data and truck telemetry data.
The APIs will generate real-time data for trucks and clickstream items, enabling analysis and downstream processing.
3.Monitoring and Visualization:
Real-time dashboards for both customer behavior and fleet management can be built by querying the data stored in DynamoDB/Snowflake.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates how real-time data integration can improve e-commerce operations by combining online platform insights and fleet management systems. The solution is scalable and can be adapted to other sectors requiring real-time data analysis and operational optimization.
